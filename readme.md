I started out with my HTML and CSS styling to make it look similar to the example. This part was fairly straightforward.

I then began using my script to hide the start button and un-hide the test elements, questions and answer buttons. This was new to me, but was very straightforward once I
managed to remove classes to add the hidden class.

I then added the timer functionality, which also was straightforward.

I found questions and created an array that involved a true/false for 'correct' so that I could later go into the array and pull from it and also pull whether it was correct.

I struggled for a while to get the buttons to display from the array correctly and sought assistance. Understanding where I made my error I was able to then populate my
question area and buttons. 

I then added the functionality for correct or incorrect answers and added a prompt, both for my testing and for the user to be aware of how they were performing.

Next was the addition of the time penalty, also fairly straightforward.

After this I then added the iteration of the array of questions and answers. This took some tinkering to figure out exactly how I wanted it done and for it to behave. In the 
end however I got it working and was satisfied with it after several tests involving trial and error and also testing the accuracy of the questions vs the answers.

Lastly was locally storing the users name and score. This went through several tests before settling on storing the name and score together as I had issues storing them seperately
and then getting them together after the fact. I made a seperate HTML sheet with its own script brackets for the high score page and added classes from the CSS sheet to 
add minor stlying to the page.
